            <h2>Welcome!</h2>
            <p>I'm Olivia Casareno, a dedicated student pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science and Information Security at John Jay College (CUNY). I expect my degree to be conferred in August of 2024. I'm passionate about leveraging technology to solve complex problems and enhance security measures. <br>
<br>
In addition to my studies, I've developed a strong technical skill set, including proficiency in C++, Slack, Python, SQL, R, and various operating systems. I'm also experienced in using the Microsoft Office suite and Wireshark for data analysis and system monitoring.
<br><br>
I am currently working towards certifications in cloud technologies such as Azure and AWS, as well as my CompTIA Security+ Certification. 
<br><br>
For fun, I enjoy working with and modifying computer hardware and building projects, such as a VPN router using Raspberry Pi.
<br><br>
I've also dedicated time to volunteering, both locally and internationally, including rebuilding an orphanage in Guatemala, providing care for individuals coping with grief, and assisting children with disabilities in Nepal. These experiences have taught me the value of compassion, empathy, and community engagement.
<br><br>
In my professional life, I've had the opportunity to work as a Technical Intern at Farm Sanctuary, where I contributed to educational content development and optimized internal communications using Slack. I've also gained valuable experience in customer service and retail management through my past roles at art exhibits, and my current role as a Home Health Aide.
<br><br>
I'm excited to continue my journey in the field of technology and make a positive impact in the world. 
<br><br>
Thank you for visiting my website, and I look forward to connecting with you!
